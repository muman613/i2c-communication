# README

This repository contains two `solutions` in Atmel Studio 7. Once runs as an i2c master sending requests to the i2c slave which handles the requests.

## Hardware

- Arduino Mega2560 running AtMega2560 AVR
- Arduino Uno running AtMega328p

## Communication

The two controllers are connected via the i2c (TWI) interface. Each SDA is connected the other other SDA and the SCL is connected to the other SCL.

This will be documented better in future revisions.
